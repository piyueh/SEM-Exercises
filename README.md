SEM Exercises
=============

This repo contains Python codes to the exercise problems in the book:
Spectral/hp Element Methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics,
2nd edition, by George Em Karniadakis & Spencer Sherwin.

It serves as not only the exercise to spectral element method but also coding 
exercises in Python. So I tried to avoid using advanced math libraries, such as
SciPy. And therefore algorithms used in some math functions may seem to be
naive. For example, the gamma and factorial functions.
